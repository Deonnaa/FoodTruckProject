I developed this program as part of my coding journey and to help users discover and rate food trucks. I hope it proves helpful to others as they embark on their coding adventures too. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's learn and code together!

## Description
The Food Truck Rating App is a Java program that allows users to interactively explore and rate various food trucks. Developed as a hands-on learning project, this application demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Java programming and user input processing.

## How to Use
1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine.
2. Run the program.
3. The program will guide you through the following steps:
	1. Enter the Food Truck Name.
	2. Specify the Food Type.
	3. Provide a Rating.
4. Once you've entered the data, you'll be presented with a menu where you can:
	1. List all existing food trucks.
	2. Calculate the average rating of food trucks.
	3. Display the highest-rated food truck.
	4. Quit the program.
5. Continue navigating through the menu until you've completed your desired actions.

## Technologies Used
- The program uses Java's `java.util.Scanner` class for user input.
- Java 1.8
- Eclipse IDE

## Lessons Learned
- Data Validation: Validate user input or data before storing it in objects. This helps prevent errors and ensures that your data is accurate and reliable.
- Managing Object References: Understand how references to objects work in Java. Modifying an object through one reference will affect all references to that object in the array.
- Updating Object Properties: If needed, update the properties of objects within the array as you iterate. Use setter methods or directly modify the object's properties.

## Usage Examples
- Food Truck 1: The Git Grill, Burgers, 2.3 
- Food Truck 2: Bytes BBQ, BBQ, 3.5
- Food Truck 3: The Debugging Diner, Pancakes, 5.0
- Food Truck 4: Binary Bakes Bakery, Desserts, 4.3
- Food Truck 5: Coders Cafe Corner, Java, 2.4
